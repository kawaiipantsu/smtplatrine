## Systemd - Setup smtplatrine step by step

I use systemd, you might not - I do.  
What ever way floats your boat you should go with that. If you use systemd to then you're in luck, as i have prepared it all. Enjoy!

### Installation steps

1) **Copy the systemd service file to it's right place:**  
`sudo cp contrib/smtplatrine.service /etc/systemd/system/`

2) **Reload the daemon to catch new service file:**  
`sudo systemctl daemon-reload`

3) **Done! Run with it "as-is" and do start / stop manually:**  
`sudo systemctl start smtplatrine.service`  
`sudo systemctl stop smtplatrine.service`

4) *(Optional)* **Enable service to automatically start on boot/startup:**  
`sudo systemctl enable smtplatrine.service`

### Check to see if it's running

To see if it's running okay you can do `sudo systemctl status smtplatrine.service` and you should get an output similar to this. If you do not, then you need to look at logs and debug the problem yourself. In most cases it's typically file permissions that are wrong. Try doing `sudo chmod 755 smtplatrine` on the main file.
